# JATE: a PWA text editor

## Description 
JATE is a full-stack application deployed to Heroku. This single-page application offers users a text editor that runs in the browser and meets PWA criteria. JATE features a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline. JATE uses the [`idb npm package`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/idb) as a lightweight wrapper around the IndexedDB API. 

Below is a visual of JATE's functionality:
